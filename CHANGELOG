+++ Looking into the future +++
- Optimize script and global cleanup
- Integrate more debugging features
- Better port names for packet error output
- Optimize output format for packet errors

+++ Version 1.0 +++
- Removed  MODE SELECTOR for all information in one check (I think thats better)
- Added more switch information in the output
- Now working with modular HPE/Aruba switches
- Fixed error with empty values
- Added better PortName when using modular switches (currently only CRC Output)
- Working now when not all modules in switch are present
- Output format in icinga more read friendly
- Combine in/out packet errors

+++ Version 0 (Base script) +++
TODO 27.10.2014:
- add snmp with authentication MODE_SELECTION (not needed in my traineeship. too less time)
- add 64bit counters for warn/crit and for output

DONE so far:
- check crc errors (done, but the warn/crits are not active yet)
- error handling
- added performance data output
- added a switch to turn on/off performance data
- add a second MODE_SELECTION: check for packet drops on in/outgoing interfaces
